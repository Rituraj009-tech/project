    <h1>Website Development Report</h1>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The objective of this project was to build a professional portfolio website to demonstrate the basic web development skills such as a website using the web technologies (html5, css3), basically JavaScript. The website is like a digital resume on which completed projects and personal information are presented in a clear and organized way. It also makes it easy for prospective employers and collaborators to reach out to the developer via the contact page.
    </p>

    <h2>Design Philosophy and UI/UX</h2>
    <p>
        The chief design philosophy of the website is clarity through simplicity. A professional color scheme using Deep slate (#2c3e50) and Bright Blue (#3498db) was chosen to represent trust, professionalism, and modern design. A sticky navigation bar was added to improve usability and ease navigation between pages without having to scroll back to the top.
    </p>

    <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
    <p>
        The website was created with the help of modern CSS Techniques, Flexbox, and CSS Grid to make it fully responsive to different screen sizes. The Projects page uses a CSS Grid layout with "auto-fit minmax(300px, 1fr)" property, which allows project cards to dynamically change based on available screen width. This approach reduces the need for excessive media queries without compromising a clean layout.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
    <p>
        One of the main challenges was maintaining a consistent layout across different pages with different background styles. This problem was solved with common navigation classes in all HTML files. Additionally, basic JavaScript form validation was added to the contact page to provide immediate feedback to users for better usability and interaction.
